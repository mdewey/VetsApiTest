# Tech questions

- I am doing the Authorization flow in a new app, and Its redirecting me to a url with `#` in the url instead of `?`. That is throwing an `state not found error`. Am a missing something? I can screen share what is happening if need be.

- I am looking into the health API, they are calling for a `Integration Control Number (ICN)`. 
    - What is that? 
    - Where can a vet find their number?, vets don't know it, it should be  
    - Do we have any test numbers?

- `state` and `nonce` are just randomly generated code, correct? The value is "meaningless"
