Good Morning Dave! I wanted to touch base with you after our call last. I was able to get this sorted out on my end. Everything is going smoothly from a tech stand point. I do have a few more questions for you That I think can be answered via 

 - Where is the data coming from? Specicially this API: https://developer.va.gov/explore/health/docs/fhir?version=current . Is it Vista data? I know that you said it was many sources, but the team wants to know where it is coming from.
 - Is this used in the existing va.gov site or ecosystem?
 - I see there are ton of "get information" endpoints, but Is there a way to correct the data if it comes back wrong?

Let me know and thanks again!
